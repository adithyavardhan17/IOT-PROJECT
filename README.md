# IOT-PROJECT
Gas Leakage Detector Using Arduino
The goal of this project is to use an Arduino microcontroller to 
create a gas leak detecting system. The central processing unit 
for this system is an Arduino, which is renowned for its ease of 
use and adaptability. To determine whether gases are present in 
the surroundings and at what concentration, the gadget uses a 
gas sensor, like the MQ series. The system initiates an alert 
mechanism when the gas concentration surpasses a 
predetermined threshold.The suggested solution is scalable, 
affordable, and easy to use. It offers monitoring in real time.
